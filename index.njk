<h1>Hi there, I'm Randall Dolifka.</h1>

<p>
I am a backend software developer who lives in Texas with my wife Kyra, our cat
Missy, and our bearded dragon Pip. I graduated from Texas A&M University in 2018
with a degree in computer science and a minor in music. When I'm not occupied
with work, I enjoy barbeque smoking, rough woodworking, and video games. One
day I hope to start my own business, but for now, I am happy to be making
quality software with great friends.
</p>

<p>
Not a hero yet, but I'll keep practicing... ðŸ™‚

<h2>I write things sometimes.</h2>

<p>
This website contains an assortment of my blog posts, articles, opinions, and
creations. I can't promise that any of it is good, but it's all written by me.

<h2>Feel free to get in touch.</h2>

<p>
Honestly, I've reached the boring part of my life where email is probably the
best way to contact me. Freel free to send an email to
